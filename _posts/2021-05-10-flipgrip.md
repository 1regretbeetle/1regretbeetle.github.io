On my quest to find the best way to play arcade-style games in TATE
(vertical oriented) mode, I came across the FlipGrip, which is a product
that was advertised to deliver exactly that. It was the result of a
successful Kickstarter campaign, and is now available at retail from
sites like FanGamer (where I got mine). It seemed like an interesting
concept, and wasn't horribly expensive (with shipping, I believe it came
in at under 25 USD), so I figured it was worth taking a shot. I did have
a few reservations about the product, which were borne out in
retrospect, and I'll be covering this below.

The FlipGrip itself is made out of a piece of thick grey plastic, with
some foam inserts placed in the cavity where your Switch will be
inserted from the front. The console only slides
in one way, but the FlipGrip makes it easy enough to identify the
correct orientation. 

As you can see from the above photo, the sides of
the FlipGrip constitute a set of "rails" that your Joycons slide into.
One important thing to be aware of is that these rails have no actual
connection to the Switch itself, and your Joycons are communicating
through bluetooth. As you might imagine, this is less than ideal, as
the FlipGrip is thus only compatible with Joycons, which lack a
functional D-pad and oftentimes suffer from joystick drift. 

Worse still is the fact that wireless third party Joycon alternatives have yet to
really deliver a quality product, so there are no other options to speak
of. To add salt to the wound, because the side rails actually obscure
the USB-C port, you can't charge the device while using the FlipGrip or
use any wired or non-bluetooth wireless controllers with it. Really, you are
wholly and unavoidably stuck with using Joycons with this bad boy.
Perhaps a Joycon mod might alleviate some of these issues, but this
seems to be quite a drastic measure to use this relatively inexpensive
product.

Moving on, the back of the device has a cute little FlipGrip logo, as
well as an eject tab, which needs to be pulled in order to slide the
Switch out of the otherwise snug "Grip" that the FlipGrip exerts.
There's also a small option for a hard-plastic credit card, which can be
wedged into the device in order to act as a make-shift "stand" for the
apparatus. This feels a bit finnicky and cheap, so it feels like a bit
of a missed opportunity. However, since the FlipGrip isn't a Switch
stand, I'm willing to give a pass for this extra "feature".

Here's a photo of my Switch and Joycons held by the FlipGrip. Overall,
the build feels solid, and I would never have to worry about the console
or controllers ever slipping out. The hold is tight in each case, and
functions exactly as intended. 

If it weren't for being stuck eternally to Joycons and the obstruction
of the USB-C port, I would be much more enthusiastic about the FlipGrip.
As it stands, it just doesn't fit my needs, as the Joycons are simply
too imprecise to seriously play any games that support TATE mode.
A simple stand that can support the Switch in vertical
mode does (almost) everything the FlipGrip can, at the expense of 
true portability/mobility. I think that the product shows a lot of
potential, and will get better once third parties catch up to improve
upon the Joycons. However, at the moment, I truly feel that the FlipGrip
is a novelty, and I won't be using it very much moving forward.
