Having just finished 13 Sentinels, and with the announcement of a Switch
port, I wanted to dedicate a post to share my thoughts on the game. 
As the delivery of the game's well-composed story is crucial to the
player experience, I will be mindful of discussing spoilers for the game.
However, caution is still advised if you want to experience the game
blind. To be particularly careful, I would avoid reading the text in 
the screenshots as they may contain minor spoilers.

13 Sentinels is the latest offering of the famed game development
studio Vanillaware, releasing in late 2019 for the PS4. While eagerly
anticipated by dedicated fans due to the company's legendary resume
(Dragon's Crown, Muramasa: The Demon Blade, and Odin's Sphere,
to name a few), the game received relatively little mainstream
attention and was quickly banished to the fringes of niche gaming
culture. The genre, being an old-school adventure title with 
very minor strategy/tactics elements,
probably contributed to its initial lack of appeal. Vanillaware and
Atlus' relatively sparse marketing campaign for the western release also
did not do it any favors. However, through word-of-mouth and several
deep discounts at retail, enough interest was garnered for a Switch
port to be green-lit and announced two years after its
initial release, reigniting
interest in Vanillaware's "black sheep". Having just beaten it
myself, I am personally excited by the thought that a brand new, and
arguably larger demographic, will soon have the chance to experience
this marvel of a game. 

Delivered from the point of view of the 13 titular protagonists, 13 Sentinels
tells the story of their efforts towards repelling the invasion of an alien army,
referred to as "kaiju" in reference to the classic genre of
Japanese monster movies, with the help of their giant robot weapons, the
"sentinels". This is done in the style of a classic 2D adventure game,
where the player guides their characters through various cutscenes full
of voiced dialogue and gorgeous hand-drawn settings in the signature
Vanillaware style.

In spite of this relatively standard narrative format, 13 Sentinels
breaks the mold through allowing the player to experience 
slices of the overall story from each character's individual viewpoint, 
and in any order of their choosing. These individual vignettes
come together to answer overarching mysteries and eventually transform
into the overarching narrative. As made possible from this ambitious storytelling
decision, one is allowed an unprecedented level of freedom in the order
by which key revelations and other important plot points are delivered, 
where different events gain additional or hidden meanings
depending on the insights revealed to the player through their past
experiences. Thus, each playthrough
of the game results in a retelling of its story in a way that is entirely 
unique. The fact that it is so tightly written and
cohesive despite managing such an extensive cast and timeline of events,
is a true accomplishment, and definitely 13 Sentinels' greatest
strength.

These achievements are even more impressive once one considers the
absolute encyclopedia of science-fiction concepts that are explored
through its run-time. Fan-favorites topics such as time-travel,
teleportation, mind-hacking, nanomachines, androids, aliens, UFOs,
quantum science jargon, virtual reality, etc. are all here and in full force.
As one might imagine, this results in a story that can be absolutely
chaotic at times, and the game really enjoys exploiting the player's
confusion to emphasize certain plot points and revelations. For fear of
saying too much, I won't go further into the game's elaborate story, as
it would require considerable effort and skill to present it in a way
that does not come across as overly complex or convoluted. Suffice it to
say that the dots are connected wonderfully by the end of its runtime,
and the whole is definitely more than the sum of these various
components of the sci-fi genre.

To help the players along their journey, Vanillaware has included a
great variety of features to ensure that the events of the game as they
unfold are easily recalled by the player. "Mystery Files" become
available as the story progresses, which essentially serve as
encyclopedia entries for each person, place, or object that is
encountered. These files are also updated as various truths are
revealed, keeping the information that they contain relevant throughout
the game's entirety. Furthermore, an "Event Archive" is available to
re-watch previous cutscenes, which are sorted by both the main
protagonist involved, as well as by any secondary characters that play a
role in them. These resources are readily available at your fingertips 
at any time during gameplay
through the START menu overlay, and can be pulled up for a quick reference
before then resuming where one left off in the story. I would like to see other
game developers copy these quality-of-life features in the future, as
they can assist in making the game's narrative more palatable to a
broader audience. A full-color manual is also included in the START
menu!

In comparison to the adventure mode, 
the pseudo-RTS/Strategy component of 13 Sentinels, which is
essentially considered a separate game-mode, is a bit under-utilized,
serving only as a supplement to the former. These battles, where the
player takes command of the 13 pilots in their sentinels to battle the
invaders, are very appealing from a visual standpoint, and really
everything from a design aspect is incredible. In particular, the UX/UI
elements and "chess-board" like presentation of the battlefield feels
especially inspired by Sci-Fi classics such as Card's Ender's Game, 
and I could not help but think of Ender's simulations
against the Buggers while playing the strategy segments of 13 Sentinels.

Despite the thoughtful visual presentation, the actual game mechanics
are a bit lukewarm. The sentinels are divided into four different
classes, and have a set of relatively standard
actions and attacks that can be executed, learned through using a
resource known as "meta-chips". There are also minor
progression systems in the form of upgrading "meta-skills" (think Orders
in Valkyria Chronicles), and minor stat bonuses can also be granted to
each party member. Your pilots also learn specific skills depending on
their personalities and their experiences in the narrative, which help
differentiate them from other units in their class. Overall, these are
the bare-essentials of a typical strategy game, and comprise a solid foundation.

However, there is simply not enough meat on the bone to sustain this
particular game-mode. With relatively few exceptions, each battle
carries the same objective, to either rout the enemy or defend for a
certain amount of time. Enemy variety is decent to start with, but
quickly descends into pallette-swap territory after only a few hours of
becoming acquainted with the system mechanics. Most disappointingly,
the game's boss battles are few and uninspired (I won't say why),
likely a casualty of the narrative decision to stick with such a
condensed cast of characters to tell the story.

A very strong baseline for a fleshed-out
strategy/real-time tactics game is laid in 13 Sentinels, but it is
simply underdeveloped. I doubt that the developers at Vanillaware are unaware of this, and
I can only speculate that there were additional factors that led to this
aspect of the game feeling incomplete. I would buy a game based on this
game-mode entirely should Vanillaware decide to revisit the concept and
provide the time necessary to properly develop it.

In summary, 13 Sentinels excels in all of the areas that matter - its
intricate story woven together by 13 individual vignettes is delivered
masterfully, its quality of life features and player resources are
top-notch, and its science-fiction roots are treated with the proper
respect. The game does fumble slightly in the climatic sentinel battles,
 but this is a small misfire when considering what
Vanillaware accomplishes here. 13 Sentinels is essential comfort food to
any lover of science-fiction, and I hope that its release on the
Nintendo Switch will give it the audience that it really deserves. 

My apologies for being so vague in sharing my thoughts on 13 Sentinels,
but it truly is a game better experienced blind. Thanks for reading.
