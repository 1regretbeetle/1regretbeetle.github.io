It is one of life's cruel ironies that the Ys series remains 
one of the most groundbreaking video game series that hasn't
yet seen the light of mainstream success. For a time, I thought that
Falcom's former flagship franchise (after the Kiseki series, and sorry
for the alliteration) 
might finally be given its rightful place in the limelight, given the
popularity of Ys VIII in the west despite its heavily flawed localization. 
Many retro-game-focused youtube channels have helped to promote Ys 
across various console generations, garnering greater 
awareness, interest, and appreciation for them. Most of the games have
now been ported to Steam and other platforoms, such as the previously
PSP and PS Vita exclusives Ys 7 and Ys Memories of Celceta, reaching a
broader audience. New merchandise, such as vinyl records and art books have even
been made available to the western audience in recent years, which is
something that you really didn't see before (despite Falcom's penchant
for merchanidsing, they never pay attention to the west). 
What's more, the going-rate
for Ys games have skyrocketed on the retro game market in the
last five years, with the PSP entries being amongst the most desirable
to own for the console. Considering all of these factors, I really
believed that we were living in a renaissance for the series
in the west, and was hoping that the next numbered title would
serve to push it even further.

It is thus a bit of a shame that Ys IX recently released in the 
west with relatively little fanfare, despite an uncharacteristically
agressive marketing effort. There can be any number of reasons as to
why: the two years between Japanese and US
release, and the staggered release between the PS4 and Switch platforms
certainly did not help. Rather than focus on the circumstances
surrounding Ys IX's less than stellar impact in the west, though, I
wanted to instead share my thoughts on game itself, and why I think it
is deserves so much more attention than what it will ever receive.

To preface, I will assume that you are generally
familiar with the Ys series, or at least Ys VIII in particular. As
a result, I won't give an overview of the general gameplay mechanics or
story of Ys IX (this information is easily available in any press review
you might find). I'll instead focus on specific qualities of the game
that I thought were notable and warranted mention. 

The first point that I want to make above all else is that this game's
structure and mechanics are based heavily on Ys VIII, and that alone
will be a sufficient litmus test for those who are on the fence about Ys
IX. Of course, the prison city of Balduq is very different than the Isle
of Seiren, but everything from a gameplay mechanic perspective is here.
For example: over the course of the game, you will gradually build a team of
compariots who serve various roles, such as refining equipment, brewing
potions, and more. Raid battles also make a prominent return, taking the
form of "Grimwald Nox battles" rather than defending your base survivor
camp. The similarities don't stop there, however. As the game
progresses, you will explore more of your new setting, gaining
access to new areas and dungeons. There are even interludes again between
story chapters, where you take control of a character that is (quite
disappointingly) less interesting and cool than Dana from the past.
Overall, if you enjoyed Ys VIII, you will definitely also enjoy Ys IX.
I fall into this category quite squarely, if you were wondering.

At the risk of making Ys IX sound too much like its older sibling, though,
I want to point out some areas where I think the former entry does
better than its predecessor. For one I belive that the main cast of Ys
IX is more likable than that of VIII. This is, at least in part, due to
the fact that you obtain these characters over the course of the game,
with one chapter being more or less dedicated to fleshing out a new
party member's backstory and personal growth. This is in contrast to Ys
VIII's cast, where everyone has the same reason to be working together
(i.e. we're all stranded on an island), and have less time dedicated to
their backstories overall. In this sense, I believe that Ys IX's
characters have more relatable personalities, and the game benefits
heavily as a result, notwithstanding the obviously out-there design of
the various Monstrum that you recruit. A major disappointment that I had
with the cast, though, is that (SPOILER) Aprilis isn't a playable
character. Given that Dana was playable (and had three different
playstyles to boot!) in VIII, I really can't see a reason why Falcom
would make this decision besides to save development costs. They both
fulfill very similar roles in their respective stories, and are equally
present/relevant in combat situations. It really is
a glaring omission in anotherwise well balanced game.

(This is the White Cat. She is my favorite).

While the game's performance is very lacking (especially on the Switch), 
and the engine itself is
showing its age, Ys IX's art and UX/UI direction are top notch. The
character portaits are beautifully illustrated, and take different poses
depending on the menu that you are in. You can freely rotate character
models during the equipment selection screen, and the journal menus are
meticulously populated with a bona-fide encyclopedia of everything you
would care to know about the game. It is obvious that a lot of love and
care has gone into the game's basic construction, and you get the
feeling that Falcom has a team of very passionate developers with a love for these
games.

However, the general setting of Ys IX being a gray-washed prison town
does serve to make the settings feel a bit less varied overall. Even
when you finally are allowed to explore the surrounding area, the
general presentation of these areas are much less radiant and
eye-catching than the Isle of Seiren. Falcom has shown that the engine
is capable of much better visuals in Ys VIII, so this seems a bit like a
deliberate choice on their part. I think that it does serve to detract
a bit from the game's presentation, however.

Some may be a bit concerned about the localization quality of Ys IX, and
I can happily report that it seems to be good, if not great overall. I
only encountered a small number of typos or awkwardly translated lines
of dialogue (and I'm rather sensitive to this sort of thing). I managed
to screencap two such instances (see below), 
but it is generally the exception rather than the rule. The voice acting
was also fine in my opinion (save for Adol, who sounds pretty bad when
he's actually forced to talk), but there is a JP voice option for those
who want it.

(I'm actually a bit of a fan of the phrase: "the more dangerous ultimate Grimwald
Nox")

On the whole, I also think that the story of Ys IX is well paced, with 
a cadence superior to that of Ys VIII (was the murder mystery island part of
that game even really necessary?). It doesn't really reach the
same emotional heights as VIII, but its sins are also much less offensive,
and this trade-off is acceptable to me. The story of Ys IX is well
delivered and is also tied up nicely, everything from the history of
Balduq, the true nature of Balduq Prison, the origin of the Monstrum
curse and the hundred years war, etc. I don't think many fans of the
series will have complaints in the story department. 

The amount of content in the game is solid. I was able to complete the
game, doing all of the optional content that I was aware of, in about 40
hours. This includes 100% exploration of each area, 100% treasure chest
completion, 100% side quest completion, 100% of the graphiti in Baldq,
and 100% of the blue feathers collected, and achieving 
100% affinity with comrades. I was missing a few monster
entries and character entries by the very end, but a general look around
the internet tells me that there are many subtle and missable things in
the game. This might make it tough to platinum if you are on
Playstation, if you are an achievement hunter. As far as replayability
goes, there is also a New Game Plus option, as well as a boss time
attack mode that you unlock after completing the game once.

I think that's about all I wanted to mention about Ys IX for now. In my
opinion, it is a completely worthy successor to Ys VIII, and even does a
number of things better (although this is expected from a sequel, I
suppose). As the second game in this style, it is not as groundbreaking
as Lacrimosa of Dana was, and this is evidenced in the corresponding
lack of waves it made on release. However this is still a worthy game in
the franchise, and will likely become more favorably viewed with time. 
Here's hoping that we can continue to enjoy Ys in the west!
