This is the first part in a series of posts I wanted to make discussing
miscellaneous aspects of JRPGs that I think are cool and warrant 
pointing out, but rarely rise to a level of importance for online
discourse in and of themselves.

The topic for the present post concerns the dynamics of JRPG party
composition.

---

It is not an understatement to say that the overall quality of a
Japanese role-playing game (JRPG) is
strongly influenced by the strength of its main cast of characters. 
There exist many examples of how a group of strongly written
protagonists can serve to carry an otherwise lukewarm narrative, and an
equal amount of examples that demonstrate the converse. Diving deeper
into this admittedly broad topic is outside of the scope of this post.
Rather, I wanted to discuss a commonly used JRPG archetype: 
the convention that the core party, 
once fully formed, is kept intentionally static throughout 
the game's duration. In other words, once a character joins your party,
they'll stick with you until the bitter end.

From a mechanical standpoint, the origin of such an archetype
is clear - players often invest considerable time into strengthening their parties,
through gaining levels and acquiring strong equipment. Depriving
the player of the chance to enjoy this strength for some portion 
of the game (if, for instance, a party member leaves or is otherwise
removed by plot), thus interrupts the player's feelings of growth and
progress. Depending on the duration that the character is separated from
the main party, and the narrative reasons for their absence, this
deprivation may foment frustration or distrust in the player.
On the other hand, an unfortunate limitation
of adopting this practice is the inevitable restrictions it places on
a game's story- that the group must remain largely united, both
physically and oftentimes ideologically, for the majority of the game's
plot.

Of course, scenario writers have been aware of this archetype for
decades, and have attempted to circumvent its inherent
limitations in a variety of ways. In some less successful efforts, 
changes in main party membership are sloppily introduced 
as circumstantial and for very brief, controlled segments
of the story. These attempts impart little
importance for the main narrative, and the benefits of splitting from the
norm are dulled significantly. 

However, there are also examples of the opposite, where the writers use
changes in party membership to greatly improve the delivery and overall quality of
the game's narrative. I will discuss a few such examples from my own
experience in detail below. Be warned that the discussion will contain minor spoilers.


### Ys Seven

![rpgm1](/assets/img/ys7_title.jpg)

Ys Seven offers a great example of how a JRPG
can enjoy the benefits of a dynamic set of party members while also
preserving their core gameplay functionalities for the player. This is
accomplished through the roles of Mustafa and Sigroon as temporary party
members, serving as counterparts to the "main" characters Cruxie and Aisha, respectively. 

These temporary party members are functionally identical to those that
they "replace" (or are replaced by) throughout the narrative. This means
that their particular battle styles and weapon skills are always accessible 
during the game, circumventing any gameplay-related issues that may have been caused due to their absence.
This is particularly important for Ys Seven, as the game specifically
emphasizes the use of "weapon type" advantages in its battle system,
making it all the more essential that Aisha's "Piercing" weapons and
Mustafa's "Striking" weapons are available to progress through the
oftentimes challenging enemy encounters encountered in the game.

The additional freedom gained through using a character "stand-in" enables 
the game to construct story threads that are rarely seen in the genre. I
will briefly touch on a few of them here.

![rpgm2](/assets/img/sigroon_aisha.png)

For example, Aisha is the crown princess of the Kingdom of Altago, and
her character arc begins with what one expect from a typical JRPG -
she sneaks off in order to adventure with Adol (the protagonist) and to
acquaint herself with the land
that she will eventually be sovereign over. However, partway through the
story, Aisha is forced into her leadership role early due to her
father's alleged assassination by Adol and company. Rather than
shirk these royal obligations and become a fugitive with the rest of the
party (as one would expect from a typical JRPG), she decides to return
to the palace, working behind the scenes to unravel her father's true
killer and clear Adol's name. 

In her place, she sends her trusted confidant and mentor, Dragon Knight
Sigroon, to assist the party. Due to the catastrophic events unfolding in the 
land of Altago, including the King's assassination, Sigroon is initially suspicious of Adol's party.
However, as the story progresses, she begins to trust the adventurers and
 aids them in their quests for the good of Altago. 
She eventually departs from the party after being gravely injured in the
attack on the capital city,
entrusting Aisha's protection to Adol and company. In the meantime,
having been exposed to the injustices that the people have suffered under the previous rule, Aisha
has matured greatly in her absence from the main cast. 
She rejoins the party with newfound resolve to see the group's mission through.

It goes without saying that Aisha and Sigroon's character arcs, and their contribution
to developing the Kingdom of Altago as a setting, would not have been possible had
Aisha remained with the party throughout the game. From a narrative
standpoint, the writers could have easily had Aisha become a fugitive
with the rest of the party, which would not lead to any major plot holes
or story inconsistencies. However, in allowing Aisha to assume her royal
obligations,
the writers succeed in delivering not one, but two satisfying character
arcs in letting Sigroon replace her. And of course, this is accomplished
without any impact to the player from a gameplay perspective.

![rpgm3](/assets/img/mustafa_cruxie.png) 

Mustafa's and Cruxie's character arcs play out in almost the inverse of
Aisha's and Sigroon's. Mustafa is the current elder of Segram Village, where Adol and company
pass through on their way to the Flame temple, one of the key story
destinations of the game. He is initially wary of the outsiders who
want to enter the village's sacred place of worship, and joins the party to
oversee them. Mustafa is presented as a reliable leader with a deep sense of
responsibility for his people and his little sister Cruxie, who is
bedridden with Iskan Fever - a mysterious illness sweeping through
Altago. 

Later in the game, and after the events at the Flame Sanctum, Adol allows Mustafa to use the
Flame Dragon Stone, a key item that they just obtained from the temple,
to cure his little sister Cruxie's terminal illness. Having recovered
her strength, Cruxie is eager to repay the kindness of those who looked
after her, and do her part in saving Altago. 
Being a Segramite warrior herself, she joins Adol and company in place 
of Mustafa, despite his objections and worries for her safety.
She notes that Mustafa, as the village elder, cannot leave the villagers for
 long, as they look to him as a leader and would perish without his 
guidance.

Rather than serving as a vehicle for more complex character development,
Cruxie as Mustafa's party member swap allows both
characters to remain consistent with their ideals, and thus
react to events more organically during the story as they occur. While
Mustafa's battle prowess is much appreciated for the party, he puts his
village obligations first and remains behind to defend them from the
ever-present threat of monster attacks, which have been growing more and
more dire over the course of Ys Seven's plot. Being given a second chance at
life, Cruxie volunteers to carry on in Mustafa's stead, wanting to
repay Adol and his cohort. While Cruxie could have easily been made to
stay behind in the village while Mustafa continues with Adol, this
outcome would have run contrary to how they are characterized in the
story. 

In summary, the dynamic party membership present throughout Ys Seven's narrative enables the 
progression of novel character arcs that are natural in the context of
the story and otherwise consistent with their values. The use of
temporary characters to enable this, while also giving such characters
their own individual development, is an innovative decision that can be
considered one of Ys Seven's strongest achievements.


### Fire Emblem Path of Radiance

![rpgm4](/assets/img/fe9_title.jpg)

While there exists an argument for not including SRPGs in this
discussion because they generally feature many more playable characters
than a "traditional" JRPG, Fire Emblem Path of Radiance contains 
two neat examples of dynamic party composition that I thought warranted mention.
In truth, Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn places a much larger emphasis on
party availability driven by plot events, but breaking that down will
likely constitute a post in and of itself. For these reasons, I'll
only discuss the former game below.

![rpgm5](/assets/img/collage_fe9.png)

Shinon is one of the first playable units you are given in Path of
Radiance, being a veteran member of the Greil mercenaries. He comes as a
pre-promote that is incredibly powerful, outclassing many of the
"trainees" in your group and conveying the breadth of
his experience as a warrior. Due to Commander
Greil's untimely death and Ike's inexperience running the mercenary
outfit, Shinon ends up leaving the group to pursue other opportunities
to elevate his status and fame.

Much later in the game, Ike's army runs into Shinon again, now a
mercenary for the Daein army (and thus, fighting for the opposing side). 
One may be surprised to learn that Shinon can actually be recruited back
into Ike's army by fulfilling a sequence of secret conditions. It is
hinted throughout the game that Shinon took an apprentice during his
time in the Greil mercenaries, whom he trained in archery. If one first
speaks to Shinon using Rolf, and then subsequently depletes Shionon's HP with Ike, he
will be recruited into your army. It is revealed that Rolf was indeed the
apprentice, and that Shinon's compassion for seeing the boy grow into an
archer, and Ike's strong leadership, were the driving force behind Shinon again
rejoining the Greil mercenaries.

I think that Shinon's story provides another example of unique character
development that was facilitated by his departure from the main party.
Being an esteemed veteran fighter with no deep ties with the outfit, it
makes sense that Shinon does not continue to fight with the severely
weakened outfit. It is only when he stands on the side opposite to the
protagonists, and when Ike subsequently bests him in battle, does Shinon
recognize that they are worthy of his talents. In addition, Shinon's compassion for
Rolf also allows him to see the value in having comrades to fight
alongside after having spent most of his life as a lone wolf. It is
appropriate that both Ike and Rolf are thus involved in Shionon's
re-recruitment.

![rpgm6](/assets/img/fe9_shinon.png)

In the same vein, Jill's potential defection from Ike's army also
serves as an interesting example of the impact of losing party members. 
Being a Daein soldier, Jill is forced to join
Ike's party due to political circumstances despite fighting for the
opposing flag. However, over the course of the game she begins to
realize the misdeeds perpetuated by Daein and grows attached to the
mercenary group, who are fighting to retake their country and overcome
prejudice against the Laguz. 

While this in and of itself would not constitute what we have called a
"dynamic" role in the party, as she remains with the group through the
game, there is a secret event that may force Jill to defect
from the group. If she speaks to her father, who is the Daein
commander encountered during Chapter 20: Defending Talrega,
she will choose to rejoin the enemy team.
However, this can be avoided if Jill has an A support with Mist, where
she will instead tell her father that she has rediscovered why she
fights: to protect the Crimean Army and her dear friends.

This entirely optional event presents a high stakes situation that
challenges Jill's loyalty to Ike's army and the extent of her
growth from the extremist Daein soldier that she once was. While it can
be easily avoided through benching Jill for the chapter, even the
spectre of her betrayal demonstrates the narrative merits of deviating
from more traditional storytelling, where Jill's loyalty would have been
a given.

In light of the achievements of the games discussed above in the way of
using a dynamic party to enhance the experience, I wanted to quickly give
an example of how the opposite effect can also be obtained if done
poorly.


### Tales of Vesperia 

![rpgm8](/assets/img/tov_title.jpg)

Tales of Vesperia is often touted as one of the primer games in the
long-running series, rivaling heavy-hitters such as Tales of Symphonia and Tales
of Abyss in terms of popularity and acclaim in the fandom. While I have
my own share of issues with the game that put me squarely outside of
that camp, I'll resist the urge to expound on them here and instead stay
on topic. 

The game takes a "spray-and-pray" approach to party membership, taking
many different approaches to shake-up your roster at any given time in
the story. Unfortunately Tales of Vesperia misses the
bullseye for nearly every shot that it takes. To keep things brief, I'll
mention two examples below.

![rpgm9](/assets/img/tov_flynn.jpg)

Take Flynn for example, a member of the imperial knights 
who acts as a foil to the main protagonist, Yuri, who is a former knight
himself. Throughout the course of the game, Flynn acts as a guest
character who joins you periodically when your party's objectives align
with those of the knights.
At first blush, this sounds reasonable and consistent with his
loyalties, despite the fact that his lack of availability makes it
difficult to use the character during gameplay.

The main issues arise from Flynn's lack of relevance when
not in the party. He receives little character development while
off-screen, and his plights as a commander in the knight company do
not yield any meaningful consequences or otherwise help develop the
story. Thus, it appears that Flynn's distinction from the party feels
more "for the sake of" rather than to accomplish anything worthwhile.
Put another way, the player suffers the gameplay-related drawbacks of
Flynn's absence without any of the narrative benefits.

The game's development history helps to shed some light on this
questionable choice. Apparently, Flynn was a non-playable secondary
character in the original release and later made playable due to fan
popularity. This helps to explain his lack of relevance throughout the game.

![rpgm10](/assets/img/tov_kidnapped.jpg)

Ready for another forced kidnapping plot device? These offer what I
would consider the worst examples of dynamic party membership that you
can include into your JRPG. I'll use Estelle's kidnapping event in Tales of
Vesperia as an example.

Being a "Child of the Full Moon", or in more base terms, a "Chosen
One" trope, Estelle is kidnapped by the main
antagonist in order to use her special abilities for nefarious purposes.
In response, the party goes on a crusade to rescue her, cumulating in
a forced boss fight with a brain-washed "Estelle". After duking it out,
Estelle hits the undo button to get rid of the mind-control with copious
amounts of yelling, and reunites with the main characters.

![rpgm11](/assets/img/tov_crap.png)

As you may be able to tell, I'm not a fan of these types of plot
devices. Rather than using the freedom of a dynamic party to
enable and empower the main characters to fulfill their goals, 
it is instead used as a means to deprive them of their agency. It feels
especially cheap when the kidnapping only occurs by virtue of a gimmicky
"chosen one" archetype. What other purpose does Estelle's inherent power have
over the course of the game except to facilitate the kidnapping plot
device? The writers use this event as the main catalyst
to her later character development (i.e. "I'll live for myself
rather than being used as a tool"), but the reliance on such crutches
just makes that development feel unearned. It goes without saying that this
kidnapping plotline detracts from BOTH the plot and gameplay experience.
Did I mention that Estelle is also your primary healer?

As I mentioned at the start of this post, there exist many creative ways
that JRPGs can shake up their character rosters to advance the writers'
visions without detriment to the core gameplay. Of course, the few that
we covered here are only a small sampling of this, and I hope to
revisit the concept in future posts as I come across other illuminating
examples. Thanks for reading.
